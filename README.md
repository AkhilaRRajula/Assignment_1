###Capstone Project: Data Science Journey
Welcome to my Capstone Project repository! Here, you'll find the culmination of my data science journey, including the hands-on labs completed throughout the course. This repository showcases the application of various data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, dashboard creation, and presentation techniques.

##Module 1: Data Collection
In Module 1, I focused on collecting data using APIs and webscraping techniques. I learned how to interact with APIs to retrieve data from various sources and extract information from websites through webscraping.

##Module 2: Data Wrangling
Module 2 introduced me to the process of data wrangling, where I learned to handle missing values, identify and remove duplicates, and normalize data to prepare it for analysis.

##Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
In Module 3, I delved into exploratory data analysis (EDA), where I explored the distribution of data, identified outliers, and examined correlations between variables.

##Module 4: Data Visualization
Module 4 focused on data visualization techniques to effectively communicate insights derived from the data. I learned to visualize the distribution of data, relationships between variables, composition of data, and make comparisons using various visualization tools.

##Module 5: Dashboard Creation
In Module 5, I learned to create interactive dashboards to present data in a visually appealing and informative manner. Dashboards provide an intuitive way to explore data and communicate key findings to stakeholders.

##Module 6: Presentation of Findings
The final module focused on presenting the findings of the analysis in a clear and concise manner. I learned to structure and deliver a compelling final presentation that effectively communicates the insights derived from the data.

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my skills and expertise in the field of data science. Thank you for exploring my Capstone Project journey!
